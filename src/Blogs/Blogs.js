                        <p className="p-5 ans "> The differences between SQL vs. NoSQL are: <br />  <br /> <br />  
                            1. SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational. <br />  <br />2. SQL databases
                            use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL
                            databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.  <br />  <br /> 3. SQL
                            databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are
                            horizontally scalable.  <br />  <br /> 4. SQL databases are table-based, while
                            NoSQL databases are documents, key-value, graphs, or wide-column
                            stores.  <br />  <br /> 5. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions,
                            while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or
                            JSON. </p>

                        <p className="p-5 ans"> JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims are not altered after issuing the token. JWTs differ from other web tokens because they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. These claims depend on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid, or what permissions the client has been granted. </p>
